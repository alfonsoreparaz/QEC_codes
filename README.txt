This repository contains the codes I created for the error correction simulations. 
It contains the files in which simulations of the three codes were performed, as well as the IBM Qauntum implementation of Shor.
Note that the heatmaps in the phase-flip code seem to yield error, I made a syntax mistake when calling it. That mistake is fixed although
the result here does not show it, and the code works as it should.
